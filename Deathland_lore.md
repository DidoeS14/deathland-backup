### [The red ones]
A bright floating ball  appears out from a pure white room. This bright ball is Kavadar. He does not know what is happening yet. The only thing he knows is that he must continue 
further out of the while room. Kavadar goes through short tutorial of the basic movements. Kavadar meets his first enemy and learns how to hit them with a basic attack. Kavadar keeps
killing some enemies on his way further. While that he is introduced to verdure 1) potions (that he will be finding from time to time throughout the game).Eventually he faces an enemy
that is holding some unique red sword. Kavadar kills him and receives the sword. He receives as well a body. He discovers that with that body he is way stronger. Kavadar continues to 
go deeper in this what looks like a dungeon, solving puzzels, going through obsticles and dealing with enemies. After some time he reaches an old stone sign that says:
"If life is what you seek you shall fear not keep. Deep ahead life awaits behind Deathland's heavy gates "
Kavadar: -Deathland? Life? Hmm... I wonder what this riddle means...
	Later Kavadar meets the Knight Of Red. The ruler of everything red.
Redéye: - Who dares to disturb my peace? 
Kavadar: -... I am... I am aah... *remembers that he don't know his own name* ...*tries to think of something* ... My name is Kav... Kad... Kavadar! Yes! My name is Kavadar <br/>
	- And who do you think you are Kavadar? Holding so nonchalantly my sword?<br/>
	- I don't know. I... I just found it on the way here. I don't even...<br/>
	- And who killed all of my guardians ?<br/>
	- I.. but they...
	- So you are the one who killed so many of my people ah? Ok, this is the final end of you!<br/>
	- The final... end? What do you mean?<br/><br/>
A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Knight of Red [K] or to spare her [S]

[K]	Kavadar:	- You and your people will no longer threaten the travelers passing through here!<br/>
	Redéye:		- You will pay for this! Remember my word! You will pay!<br/>

|Nothing happens|

[S]	Kavadar:	- Here is your sword. Just let me be, ok ?<br/>
	Redéye:		- *catches her breath* Keep it. You weld it good.<br/>
			- Thank you then. I didn't catch your name.<br/>
			- It's Redéye... Tell me Kavadar. Why are you really here? You are not a standart dodger.	2) <br/>
			- I don't really know. I don't even know where I am coming from.<br/>
			- Ah, you are one of them. One of the consecrated ones. I should kill you right here and now. But since you spared my life I will spare your as well. 3) <br/>
			- Wait I don't understand really what do you mean?<br/>
			- You will find out soon enough. I wish you best of luck! You will need it, Kavadar! - Goes away.<br/>
|Mana regen goes faster|

### [The green ones]
Kavadar continues down the dungeon, soon enough he finds a green object and notces that if he touches it he gets hurt.
In the next part Kavadar meats mostly puzzels, traps and obsticles that include the hurtful green and his red to show to the player the basic color mechanic
Eventually he starts seeing green enemies and he notices that they seem easier to hurt with his red sword. Soon after Kavadar meets Lord Moss.
	Radi'lus:	-Aaah. A red being dares crossing my biome? You must be the most brave or the most stupid of all.<br/>
	Kavadar:	-Is it... forbidden to cross through here?<br/>
			-Ofcourse it is you fool! Now prepare to be destroyed!<br/>
			-Oh, here we go again.<br/><br/>
A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Lord Moss [K] or to spare him [S]

[K]	Radi'lus:	-Now I see why you are so powerful. You are a consecrated dodger! You must die! Die! Here and now, die!<br/>
	Kavadar: 	-You are the one who dies now! *kills him* *absorbs the green*<br/>
|Nothing happens|<br/>

[S]	Radi'lus:	- Now I see why you are so powerful. You are a consecrated dodger! You must die! Die! Here and now, die!<br/>
	Kavadar: 	- Yeah? And what is this thing consecrated dogder? Why everyone hates this thing?<br/>
-Oh no, no ,no,no. You are chosen! Chosen by the Necrosis to go back to the prevous realm! We should stop you!<br/>
-What? Wait, what is the Necrosis, what prevous realm?<br/>
			- You really don't know ah?<br/>
			- Obviously.<br/>
			- Well I will not tell you.<br/>
			- Eh, ok then. Bye! *goes away*<br/>
			- Wait, where do you think you are going?<br/>
			- I don't know. Wherever this path lead me.<br/>
			- Eh... eeh.. Wait! I want to give you something for not ending my life. Take this power. *gives the power of green* it should be helpful on your way down.<br/>
			- Oah! Thank you... eh...<br/>
			- Radi'lus.<br/>
			- Radi'lus!, yes thank you. My name is Kavadar by the way.<br/>
 			- Remember one thing, Kavadar. We are not friends, I give you this gift so you can get corrupt... ah... I mean... from pure kindness. The next time I see you I will kill you.<br/>
			- Then I will be ready to throw your stones on your own head. Goodbye Radi'lus! *goes away*<br/>

|Player receives something, idk xD we will think about it|<br/>

### [The blue ones]
Kavadar notices that the dungeon is going more and more deeper down. Eventualy he finds an old sign that says:<br/> "We came from Terrene, but Necrosis gave birth to us. Together with thy zingiberene we signed a truce. For the cause of defeating thy gods. So we won, omitting the odds"<br/>
Kavadar: -Hm... I am very intrigued. I should find more information about the past of this place. Better open my eyes for such signs.<br/>
Again Kavadar eventualy meets the ruler of the blue biome Semigod Of Blue. <br/>

Bubble'Blu: -Ah! You should be the consecrated one. I have heared what you did in the Red and the Green biome. And honestly I should thank you. Now my people will manage to take over their terrotories easier.
We shall not fight now. I will even forgive you for slaughtering some of my men and let you go. What do you say dodger ? <br/>
Kavadar choses to agree[A] or to continue the conversation[C] <br/>

[A] Kavadar: -Well ok. You seem like a nice guy. Thank you. *goes on his way* <br/>
|Semigod Of Blue attacks him while Kavadar is defenceless and the battle begins with Kavadar on half health|<br/>

[C] Kavadar: -And why should I trust you? Don't you need to kill me because I am a consecrated one like the other rulers?<br/>
Buble'Blu:- No... no,no,no. You see dodger I am not like the others. I don't follow the rules of this wreched realm. I like to use a good chance when I see it. You understand?<br/>
-Ok... May I ask you something?<br/>
-Sure dodger.<br/>
-What is your name? <br/>
-I am Bubble'Blu! The Semigod Of Blue.<br/>
-Ok, Semigod Of Blue. If you don't want to kill me then tell me why there are some of your people above us, being ready to shoot me?<br/>
-Eh? Well they... Oh crap! Ok boys, kill him!<br/>
|Fight begins|<br/>

A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Semigod of Blue [K] or to spare him [S] <br/>

[K] Kavadar: -Your lies are sharper than your trident, Semigod! <br/>
Buble'Blu: - No! Dodger, listen to me, I can help you! I can help you find the way to Terrene. Just let me be!<br/>
-Your lies will not be able to hurt anyone anymore! Goodbye, Samigod! <br/>
*absorbs the blue power from the semigod*<br/>
|Player receives something|

[S] Kavadar: -Your lies are sharper than your trident, Semigod! <br/>
Buble'Blu: - No! Dodger, listen to me, I can help you! I can help you find the way to Terrene. Just let me be!<br/>
-First tell me what is happening and why everyone tries to kill me ? <br/>
-If the other rulers find out that I told you they will kill me! <br/>
-It's either them or me. Which do you choose? <br/>
-oh... Ok, ok. I will tell you. Now listen. Dodgers like you are meant to go back to the realm you came from. You were a good person there probably. Talanted at something. But since
The Long Forgotten Gods fell we decided not to let anyone come back anymore.<br/>
-Wait... What? I... I again have more questions than answers. Why and how did I came here? What are these gods? Why you don't allow people to go to this realm? What is happening?<br/>
-Oh you poor dodger. Look at yourself. Do you remember your body to look like that? ... You are dead dodger...<br/>
-This... this cannot be. I don't remember anything like that... Now when I think about it... I don't remember anything!<br/>
-Your memories are lost, dodger. Only your knowledge remains. This is what remains through all the realms you go through.<br/>

Crowd of mixed color beings: -Kavadar! Kavadar! Kavadar!<br/>

Buble'Blu: -I think you will have a company.<br/>
Kavadar: -I guess so.<br/>
-Ok good luck... Kavadar. Don't be a stranger!<br/>
-Hey I thought you will help me... Eh.. whatever... *some big drop of water falls on Kavadar and he receives the blue power from Buble'Blu*<br/>

Buble'Blu leaves and many mixed color beings come to attack Kavadar. Most of them are from colors that he met already, but some of them are like Brown and Pink.<br/>

### [The crossroad]

After Kavadar defeats or escapes from the crowd he will be on a crossroad. He will be able to choose between two paths. One that leads forward and one that leads seemingly only down. It does not matter which one
he will choose exactly, because anyway after he does one he will need to do the other as well. Lets say he chooses the path down. After many obsticles, traps and enemies he reaches the deepest area in the doungeon
There are few puzzels with colors that he does not posses. Eventually he reaches a shaft where he hears a distant voice. <br/>

God Tsal: -Who is there? Is it you again Plum'fe? Didn't you get tired of shaming me for my blunder?<br/>
Kavadar: -Eh... no. My name is Kavadar. How did you get in there?<br/>
-Kava...? Kavadar? colored beings should not have names. Are you a new ruler that claimed the powers that once were part of mine?<br/>
-Well no. I am just trying to find the way out if this place.<br/>
-The way out? Are you...? Are you a consecrated dodger?<br/>
-Yeaaas... This is what some creatures here called me.<br/>
-Oh no! I am literaly the only person in this realm that will help you, believe it or not. But first you need to get me out of here! Only we can help each other.<br/>
-Ok but how can you help me ?<br/>
-I know how to defeat the rulers of thy realm! As well as how to bring you back to Terrene.<br/>
-Terrene... You mean... You know how to bring me back to life ?<br/>
-Yes! And I will. Just you need to get me out of here!<br/>
-Ok then, how should I do that?<br/>
-It will not be easy. You will need to find Empress Ov Pinks - Plum'fe. You need to steal her key to this shaft so I can climb out.<br/>
-Where can I find her?<br/>
-*esfe afegv egfer*<br/>
-What? You are too far away, I can't hear.<br/>
-* dsfsd refg s sfws*<br/>
-Ok you know what? I will find her by myself, don't worry. I will be back soon.<br/>
-Be careful dodger! Don't consume any *safs fse*, because they will *safew* you!<br/>
-I can't hear you, but ok! I will deal with it.<br/>

### [The brown ones]<br/>
Kavadar continues on his way. He passes through the Brown biome where he meets the Brown King. Brown King raises out from the mud in front of Kavadar and starts the conversation:<br/>

Mudmor'g: <br/>
-Ah, Kavadar! The consecrated one! The kingslayer! The murderer of all colored beings! They warned me that you could come for me. So I prepared<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-I did not come to fight you, but if you stand in my way I will not have any other choise!<br/>
-Oh, brave, aren't we? Bring it in consecrated one!<br/>

A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill Mudmor'g [K] or to spare him [S] <br/>

[K]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-You muddy coward! I will end you!<br/>

Mudmor'g:<br/>
-You will sorry for what you did dodger!<br/>
-I don't think so! <br/>
*kills Mudmor'g and absorb his power*<br/>"
|Some negative effect|<br/>

[S]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-You are such a coward. <br/>
Mudmor'g:<br/>
-You can't blame me for wanting to save my finall live.<br/>
-Huh... I guess so mudball. How do you even know if there is no other live after this one as well?<br/>
-Huh? Hahaha... Dodger, I am thousands of years older than you. I witnessed the Old Forgotten Gods when they were still glorious. They themselves, the creators of everything told
us that there is nothing after this life! You can't make me throw my live away as easy as you think.<br/>
-I am not trying to. Whatever. I will be going on my way.<br/>
-Is that so? I think you are forgetting something.<br/>
-Really? What?<br/>
*Borwn King powers up Kavadar with his brown power and runs away*<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-What? What was this for? Oh... well I guess such powers are always welcome... But I am really starting to get suspicious.<br/>
|Kavadar gets some possitive effect|

###[The Pink ones]<br/>
Kavadar enters the Pink biome, again the usual with levels and stuff. At some point he enters a big empty room. Sudenly he hears a voice fro somewhere:<br/>
Plum'fe:<br/>
-So the old man have sent a consecrated dodger after me?<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-You must be Plum'fe. Where are you hiding?<br/>
-Do you really think that you will manage to defeat me, dodger? I am not like the rulers you met. <br/>
-Show yourself you shadow!<br/>
-And what will you do if I do so? You are so weak that I can kill you without even rising my hand.<br/>
-That's enough! Stop toying with me!<br/>
-As you wish... Kavadar.<br/>
*the whole air starts to become pink, Kavadar chooses to become [A]Blue or to become [C]Red*<br/>

[A]<br/>
Kavadar becomes Blue, because of his shape he does not breathe the pink air, because of the water mask he have.<br/>
|battle begins with Kavadar having full health|<br/>

[C]<br/>
Kavadar becomes Red, but this achives nothing.<br/>
|battle begins with Kavadar having half health|<br/>
In this boss battle the boss will use the pink air from time to tie

Kavadar manages to defeat the Empress Ov Pinks but she have more than enough strenght to escape.<br/>
Plum'fe:<br/>
-We will meet again Kavadar! The next time you will not be as lucky as today!<br/>
*Empress Ov Pinks goes away but drops the key for Tsal's prison, so Kavadar picks it up*<br/>
-I don't worry empress. The next time I will be more powerful as well!<br/>

Kavadar goes back trough another way because the way he came from is blocked.<br/>

### [Free god]<br/> 

Kavadar reaches again the place where God Tsal was prisoned.
-Hey Tsal, Tsal it's me, Kavadar. I got the key!
-Kavadar? Oh, that is really good. Hurrt now, open the shaft.
*Kavadar opens the shaft with the key*
Tsal crows out to reveal his look. He looks really unnatural for this
demention. <br/> (Dido suggesting here :D : I was thinking maybe to look black,
scary tall, creepy and evil, something like that as a contrast his good personality. Or maybe to be white and to look like a flying body part, idk something strange you know ? :D Anyway I guess we will leave this for further discution later.)<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-...<br/>
-So Kavadar. Let's get you back to your realm.
*Kavadar smiles while looking at Tsal and Tsal does the same*
-Sooo... Won't you send me back with your god powers or something?
-Ah? What? No, I can't do that anyway. I never could. You need to help me
take back my control over this real and then I will bring you to the gates
of Deathland. They will bring you back.
-Oh man... But how? What kind of god are you?
-You see Kavadar, we were more before. I had 12 more brothers long ago.
Each of us had different powers, all weak by themselves. But when combined together we were unstopable. We together created the 5 realms and everything living and existing in them. We created the dodgers as well. Since our favorite realm was Terrene, we wanted to improve it as much as possible. The problem was that only the dodgers could do that. So we reorganised the realms in a such way
that they allow only to the dodgers which improved somehow Terrene to be able to come back there and continue making that world better. Yes but the nations of Deathland did not like that. They also wanted to go to Terrene. And since their phisical form in Deathland did not allow them  to pass the gate to Terrene they decided not to allow anyone ever go back there ever again. This was after our fall.<br/>
-And where are your brothers in fact? Locked somewhere else perhaps?<br/>
-I am afraid not. Using their final powers they transformed their phisical bodies as energy, so they could manipulate the rulers, that took our place, and make them start a  meaningless war that still continues. They hoped that this way some of them will decide to free me and use me as their advantage, but... they were wrong. Everything became even worse since then. Before consecrated dodgers could sneak around the rulers, but now this seems impossible. The rulerses military setting allows them to locate and destroy each consecrated dodger. It's a really big luck that you are still alive.<br/>
-Probably is luck as well that I managed to defeat some rulers and get some of their power. <br/>
-About this... How did you manage in fact? Youd did not have a body when you came here.<br/>
-I don't know. I picked up a sword that turned out to be property of the Knight of Red. Perhaps that gave me body.
-Hm... Redéye have became careless. Listen, there is one really important thing that I want to tell you about these powers.  I tried to tell you the previous time but you couldn't hear me. <br/>
-What is it ?<br/>
-You need to be careful what you... Kavadar, look out, colored beings, they found us. Run dodger, I will meet you later. <br/>
God Tsal shadow slips (like Agu from samourai jack xD) and runs away.<br/>
Kavadar fights with the colored beings and continues on his way.<br/>
Again puzzels, mazes, obsticles and so on until he reaches the  orange biome.<br/>

### [The orange ones]
Kavadar goes throughout the level and meets the orange ruler.<br/>
On the way he finds a new sign, that seemingly looks newer that the previous ones, that says:<br/>
"To color belive not, to shape neither<br/>We are all to go, all to wither<br/>Thy war emrased my fear<br/>As I die distrustful here"<br/>
-I guess that war is really breaking people down. Good that soon all will be over. <br/>
Kavadar sees that the orange ruler is in something like big chamber and he needs to go thorough some obsticles to go around to reach him.<br/>
The Cantaloupe Bishop: -Ah the simple dodger, that tries to go back to his realm.You came here to help the old excuse of god claim his throne again by killing me?<br/>
-What ? How do you know about Tsal? <br/>
-I know everything dodger, don't be silly. Now come here and let's be over with it!<br/>
Kavadar goes thorugh the boss level to reach The Cantaloupe Bishop.  While that Cantaloupe Bishop yells stuff to him like:<br/>
"You will never manage to kill me!", "Your chances to defeat me are less than 0","You are walking towards your final death","I know every move that you can think of, I can predict each of your steps" and so on <br/>
Kavadar goes to the Cantaloupe Bishop and slaps his ass. Now he chooses either to kill [K] or to spare[S] the bishop.<br/>

[K]<br/>
Kavadar: -You knew I will defeat you. Why you did not escape?<br/>
Bishop: -You can't escape from your destiny. I am more calm than ever now, knowing that I reached mine.<br/>
*Kavadar kills him and absorbs his power*<br/>
Tsal comes in the room runing.<br/>
Tsal: -Kavadar! Kavadar, what did you do? Why did you kill him?<br/>
-He was our enemy Tsal, he could stay in our way.<br/>
-No, not about that, you ignorant dodger! This was the important thing that I wanted to tell you about these powers! Every time you kill a ruler you gain their powers.<br/>
-And what? Isn't this good?<br/>
-No, you fool! Your phisical form can't handle that much power, you are not a god to do so. The powers will corrupt you over time and will make you a regular colored being! Then the powers will leave you and go in the closest god, which is me. Further more these powers react to your actions. If you do evil with them they will corrupt you faster, if you do good the corruption will be reduced for a short period of time. Tell me dodger, how many rulers did you kill till now?<br/>
-Well...<br/>
-Oh no! This is really, really bad! <br/>
-Well look, I didn't kill Plum'fe and...<br/>
-We need to hurry, Kavadar! You don't have much time. Go further to the Pink biome. You need to defeat Plum'fe there. Please try not to kill her Kavadar, it's for your own good.<br/>
-Ok Tsal. <br/>
|negative thing happens|<br/>

[S]<br/>
Kavadar: -You knew I will defeat you. Why you did not escape?<br/>
Bishop: -You can't escape from your destiny. I am more calm than ever now, knowing that I reached mine.<br/>
-Well no. You were wrong this time. Everyone chooses his destiny.<br/>
-Maybe you are right dodger. Maybe we really choose our own destiny.<br/>
*the bishop stabs himself on Kavadar's sword*<br/>
Bishop: -I am always right, you fool! <br/>
Kavadar: -No, why to do this? Tell me why?<br/>
*Kavadar absorbs the orange power*<br/>
Tsal comes in the room runing.<br/>
Tsal: -Kavadar! Kavadar, what did you do? Why did you kill him?<br/>
-I did not... I.. I....<br/>
-You ignorant dodger! This was the important thing that I wanted to tell you about these powers! Every time you kill a ruler you gain their powers.<br/>
-And what now? <br/>
-Well, your phisical form can't handle that much power, you are not a god to do so. The powers will corrupt you over time and will make you a regular colored being! Then the powers will leave you and go in the closest god, which is me. Further more these powers react to your actions. If you do evil with them they will corrupt you faster, if you do good the corruption will be reduced for a short period of time. Tell me dodger, how many rulers did you kill till now?<br/>
-Well...<br/>
-Oh no! This is really, really bad! <br/>
-Well look, I didn't kill Plum'fe and...<br/>
-We need to hurry, Kavadar! You don't have much time. Go further to the Pink biome. You need to defeat Plum'fe there. Please try not to kill her Kavadar, it's for your own good.<br/>
-Ok Tsal. <br/>
|Receives a good but not too good trait|

Kavadar goes to the pink biom<br/>

### [The Pink ones part two]
Kavadar enters the pink biom, noticing that now there are not only pink colored creatures but many others. He sees even such that he never met  before like yellow. But most of the beings there surprisingly are purple.<br/>
He reaches the Plum'fe's chember and sees that she is with her back towards him doing something.<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-Plum'fe! <br/>
Plum'fe:<br/>
-Consecrated one. Are you ready to face your destiny?<br/>
-Bring it on empress!<br/>
At this moment many colored beings come to kill Kavadar, he jumps around and fights them, after a while he barely manages to kill them.<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-Face me Plum'fe! Do you fear my power that much?<br/>
Plum'fe gets angry and decides to join the battle.<br/>
Kavadar defeats her, even though the battle is really hard with more stages and even places where Kavadar needs more to run around than to fight her. In the end he again chooses either to kill [K] or spare [S] her.<br/>

[K]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-I think you overestemated your power empress.
Plum'fe:<br/>
-I might have, but my death does not mean that you will reach your goal dodger! Soon or later you will meet the Yellow Devine. They will be the end of you, because my power was just a little fraction of their. You will never manage to defeat them.<br/>
-There is only one way to find out if this is true.<br/>
*Kavadar kills Plum'fe and takes her power*
Tsal again comes from somewhere.<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-Kavadar! Did you not understand what I told you? Why did you need to kill her? We could imprison her.<br/>
-I understand your thirst of revenge Tsal, but she was too dangerous!<br/>
-It is not revenge you fool. You are really... eh... You really disapoint me dodger. Keep going. Your time is running out.<br/>
Kavadar doesn't say anything and just moves on.<br/>
|negative effect|<br/>

[S]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-I think you overestemated your power empress.
Plum'fe:<br/>
-I might have, but my death does not mean that you will reach your goal dodger! Soon or later you will meet the Yellow Devine. They will be the end of you, because my power was just a little fraction of their. You will never manage to defeat them.<br/>
-There is only one way to find out if this is true... Prepare yourself to...<br/>
-Do as you must.<br/>
Tsal again comes from somewhere.<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-Kavadar, no! Don't kill her, did you forgot what I told you?<br/>
-You... you are right. Take her Tsal. She is not my responsibility.<br/>
-Ok empress. It's time for you and me to have a little talk together.<br/>
-No! No!.  *Plum'fe tries to escape*
Tsal takes small portion of her power and gives it to Kavadar.
-Here this shout be just enough to help you on the way and not need corrupt you as well. Now hurry. You don't have a lot of time.<br/>
-Sure, later Tsal.<br/>
|Positive effect|<br/>

### [The purple ones]
Kavadar enters the purple biom , levels, enemies, obsticles puzels and so on<br/>
He reaches Lord Maulve and aproaches him.
Maulve:<br/>
-Kavadar, Kavadar, Kavadar. Kavadar here, Kavadar there, Kavadar everywhere.<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-You... know my name?<br/>
-You took over almost the whole Deathland and stole the powers of all my rivals. And of course I know what you will try to do next.<br/>
-Then prepare yourself.<br/>
The fight begins, Lord Maulve rely mostly on his minions. Eventualy Kavadar defeats everyone.<br/>
-No! I will not end up like the others. You will not take my power!<br/>
Kavadar chases Mauilve through out most of the biom and reaches him again.<br/>
-Stop being a coward!<br/>
The next stage of the fight starts. At the end of the stage Maulve uses his dark magic to grow big and eat Kavadar. The final stage is inside Maulve's stoach. There is like a dinamic level that always changes, toxic juces fall all around, purple creatures appear and attack Kavadar. There he tries to reach one spot in the stomach that he must damage enough so Maulve can give up. Every time Kavadar hits that spot tha platform falls and he needs to go up again fro the  bottom.
Once Kavadat damages this spot the spell breaks and the giant body of Maulve disolves and frees Kavadar. Then Kavadar chooses either to kill [K] or spare [S] Maulve.<br/>

[K]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-You run like a coward, you fight like a coward and now you die like a coward!<br/>
*Kills Lord Maulve without even giving him a chance to answer and absorbs his power*<br/>
Kavadar hears Tsal's voice from somewhere but does not see him<br/>
-Kavadar, once you get corrupted I will not be able to help you! Be really careful dodger.<br/>
Kavadar looks around. Then once he got he will not be able to see Tsal anywhere he moved on his way.<br/>
|negative effect|<br/>

[S]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-You run like a coward, you fight like a coward and you get defeated like a coward.<br/>
Maulve:<br/>
-Don't... don't take my powers, please, they have beein in my family from generations!
-Worry not. I will not take your powers. God Tsal will. I will take just a bit.<br/>
-No! No, no no, please!<br/>
*Kavadar takes some of Maulve's power*<br/>
-Say hi to Tsal from me. *Kavadar leavs Maulve alone*<br/>

### [The yellow ones]
Just before Kavadar can enter in the yellow biom Tsal comes to him.<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-I want to warn you Kavadar. All the beings in this biom have powers.<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-What? All of them have god powers?<br/>
-Well not exactly. Amber and Xanthous, the so called Yellow Devine have discovered that if they willingly share even a small peace of their power with other beings, they will increase their own power by a lot. Xanthous was the first and only biom ruler that decided to share his power with the one he loves. This made him and his fiancé the most powerful rulers with the most powerful people in the whole realm.<br/> 
-I understand. I will be careful, Tsal!<br/>
-Good luck, Kavadar. All the realms rely on you.<br/>

Kavadar enters the yellow biom, puzzels, obsticles and stuff.<br/>
At the end he reaches the castle of The Yellow Devine. He goes there and
after some maze wondering he reaches the Yello Devine.<br/>
*the Yellow Devine talking in one voice*<br/>
-Kavadar the consecrated one! You finally came to us.<br/>
-Yes and I am ready to defeat you the same way I defeated all before you.
-Hahahahaha. You are really foolish Kavadar! We are hundred times stronger than anyone you met before. You can't defeat us even with all the power of the Old Forgotten Gods!<br/>
-Well... I don't know about their whole power. But I have just enough to make sure you both won't be able to move after our battle!<br/>
*the yellow devine gets engry*<br/>
-Die you little bug!<br/>
The yellow devine tries to smash Kavadar but he manages to dodge the hit. The battle begins. No matter wwat Kavadar does he can't match the devine, evemtualy he losses almost all of his health. When this happens Tsal appears and absorbs some of the Yellow Devine's power.<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-Here, Kavadar! Get up, you have a battle to win!  *Tsal again dissapears in the shadows*<br/>
-You foolish excuse of god! You will be next after we finish with you minion!<br/>
Kavadar gets up and again tries just to beat the boss. Then he hears Tsal's voice:<br/>
-Go for their eyes, Kavadar. If they can't see you they can't hurt you.<br/>
4 stages come where in each of them Kavadar takes down one of the couple's eyes.
When Kavadar manages to do that Tsal comes again and absorbs a bit more from their powers.<br/>
-Hit them now, Kavadar. They are more weak!<br/>
After Kavadar finishes this stage as well the Yellow Devine gets more angry.<br/>
-That's enough! We will make you sorry for this Kavadar! Together we are stronger!<br/> *The devine calls every yellow being in the realm and combines them with themselves to become one gigantic titan*<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-Go Kavadar, climb in and get to their brain. This is their weak spot!<br/>

Kavadar goes trough the titan level which requires speed and acuracy and reaches their brain. He penetrates it and absorbs some of their power. This destroys the titan and weakens The Yellow Devine to the level of Kavadar.<br/>
*Kavadar receives yellow powers*
They take the time while falling to recover themselves from the leathal damage that Kavadar gave them. After that they try to escape. Kavadar chases them trough some levels and eventualy reaches them just before the gates of Deathland.<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-It's over, devine ones! There is no where else to run!<br/>
Xanthous:<br/>
-You are right. No for us and no for you! *tries to destroy the gates with a blast, but Tsal comes from nowhere and deflects it.<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-Cmon Kavadar, let's defeat them once and for all!<br/>

Kavadar fights with Xanthous while Tsal fights with Amber. The next stage they switch. Kavadar injures Amber really bad, which causes Xanthous to slip from Tsal and start attacking Kavadar with all the power he has left. Kavadar eventualy manages to defeat Xanthous as well and chooses to either spare [S] spear the couple or kill [K] them.<br/>

[S]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-Calm down Xanthous. I will not hurt you or your girl. I just want to come back to my realm. Nothing more.<br/>
Xanthous:<br/>
-...<br/>
Amber:<br/>
-Do you realize what you did?! You ruined everything, so many lives, so many...<br/>
 Tsal:<br/>
 -Shut your trap, Amber! You are literaly the last person that have the right to speak right now! Be glad that the dodger spared you!<br/>
 - ...<br/>

[K]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
-Your thirany is over Yellow Devine!<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-Kavadar, no! <br/>
*Kavadar kills Amber and Xanthous before anyone could even do somethin*<br/>
Tsal:<br/>
-Kavadar... what did you gain by this?... Go... Go to the gates, but I don't promise you that they will allow you to go back.<br/>
-...<br/>

### [End of the story]

Kavadar stands before the gates. They either accept him [A] or deny him [D] depending on his actions in deathland. If he has the perfect balance between kills and spares he have third ending [O].<br/>

[A]<br/>
The gates open for him. He steps in and looks back at Tsal. Tsal waves at him and tells:<br/>
-I hope we will not meet soon again Kavadar! Take care!<br/>
Kavadar waves back at him. At Terreene he starts his new live as a newborn baby, with no memories of what happened in Deathland. <br/>

[D]<br/>
The gates do not open for Kavadar. He looks back at Tsal and Tsal lowers his head with a sad expression. Kavadar notices that he a black tint spreads on his body. Within few seconds he becomes all black and freezes like a statue.<br/>
-I warned you Kavadar... Now the best I can do is to let you live here as a colored being... I am sorry, dodger. Tsal absorbs the powers from Kavadar, which turnsn Kavadar into a red colored being. He does not remember what he did till now. Tsal dissapears in the shadows and leaves Kavadar to wonder in the depts of Deathland.<br/>

[O]<br/>
The gates open for Kavadar, but he does not step in. Instead he turns to Tsal and tells him:<br/>
-So... What do you plan to do now?<br/>
-I will restore the realm and try to think of something that will prevent such rebelion from ever happening again. Why ?<br/>
-That sound great, Tsal... Ehm... I will not remember anything after I come back to Terreene, right?<br/>
-I am afraid you won't, dodger.<br/>
-Eh... Tsal... I want to give you something as a memory from me. Come.<br/>
Tsal comes closer to Kavadar. Kavadar uses this moment to take out his sword and penetrate Tsal.<br/>
-Since I am here I wonder what would happen if you try to kill a god.<br/>
*Tsal is in shock*<br/>
-Kavadar...<br/>
*Kavadar starts absorbing Tsal's powers*<br/>
-To be honest I really liked the taste of power. I think I am good replacement of you old god. I will never make the same mistakes as you. With your powers I will destroy anyone who dares not to obey me!<br/>
-Your body... can't handle my power you fool...<br/>
-Then I will change my body when it's needed. I have an endless supply of evercoming creatures here, that I can use as my body.<br/>
-Kavadar... You are the end of all the 4 realms! <br/>
-Don't be silly old man. I am sorry you won't live to see my triumph over these realms!<br/>
Kavadar absorbs the last drop of Tsal's powers, which causes Tsal to wither and decompose into particles.<br/>
Kavadar goes back to absorb all the left powers from the biome rulers that have survived so he can become even more powerful.<br/>
Since then Kavadar started rulling the 4 realms with iron fist for long, long times.<br/>
