# MAIN STORY
*************

### [The red ones]

A bright floating ball appears out from a pure white room. This bright ball is 
Kavadar. He does not know what is happening yet. The only thing he knows is 
that he must continue further out of the white room. Kavadar goes through a 
short tutorial of the basic movements. Kavadar meets his first enemy and learns 
how to hit them with a basic attack. Kavadar keeps killing more enemies on his 
way. During that time he is introduced to verdure 1) potions (that he will be 
finding from time to time throughout the game). Eventually he faces an enemy 
that is holding a unique-looking red sword. Kavadar kills him and receives the 
sword. He also receives a body. He discovers that with that body he is way 
stronger. Kavadar continues to go deeper in what looks like a dungeon, solving 
puzzels, going through obsticles and dealing with enemies. After some time he 
reaches an old stone sign that says:<br/>
"If life is what you seek you shall fear not keep. Deep ahead life awaits 
behind Deathland's heavy gates"<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
    -Deathland? Life? Hmm... I wonder what this riddle means...<br/>
Later Kavadar meets the Knight Of Red. The ruler of everything red.<br/>
Redéye:<br/>
    - Who dares to disturb my peace?<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
    -... I am... I am aah... *remembers that he don't know his own name* 
    ...*tries to think of something*... My name is Kav... Kad... Kavadar! Yes!
    My name is Kavadar<br/>
	- And who do you think you are Kavadar? Holding so nonchalantly my sword?<br/>
	- I don't know. I... I just found it on the way here. I don't even...<br/>
	- And who killed all of my guardians?<br/>
	- I.. but they...<br/>
	- So you are the one who killed so many of my people ah? Ok, this is the 
	final end of you!<br/>
	- The final... end? What do you mean?<br/><br/>

A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Knight of Red [K] or to 
spare her [S]

[K]<br/>
Kavadar:
    - You and your people will no longer threaten the travelers passing through
    here!<br/>
Redéye:
    - You will pay for this! Remember my word! You will pay!<br/>

Result: Nothing happens

[S]<br/>
Kavadar:<br/>
    - Here is your sword. Just let me be, ok?<br/>
Redéye:<br/>
    - *catches her breath* Keep it. You weld it good.<br/>
    - Thank you then. I didn't catch your name.<br/>
    - It's Redéye... Tell me Kavadar. Why are you really here? You are not a 
    standart dodger.	2) <br/>
    - I don't really know. I don't even know where I am coming from.<br/>
    - Ah, you are one of them. One of the consecrated ones. I should kill you 
    right here and now. But since you spared my life I will spare yours as well. 3) <br/>
    - Wait I don't understand really. What do you mean?<br/>
    - You will find out soon enough. I wish you best of luck! You will need it, 
    Kavadar! - Goes away.<br/>

Result: Mana regen goes faster

### [The green ones]
Kavadar continues down the dungeon, soon enough he finds a green object and notces that if he touches it he gets hurt.
In the next part Kavadar meats mostly pizzels, traps and obsticles that include the hurtful green and his red to show to the player the basic color mechanic
Eventually he starts seeing green enemies and he notices that they seem easier to hurt with his red sword. Soon after Kavadar meets Lord Moss.
	Radi'lus:	-Aaah. A red being dares crossing my biome? You must be the most brave or the most stupid of all.<br/>
	Kavadar:	-Is it... forbidden to cross through here?<br/>
			-Ofcourse it is you fool! Now prepare to be destroyed!<br/>
			-Oh, here we go again.<br/><br/>
A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Lord Moss [K] or to spare him [S]

[K]	Radi'lus:	-Now I see why you are so powerful. You are a consecrated dodger! You must die! Die! Here and now, die!<br/>
	Kavadar: 	-You are the one who dies now! *kills him* *absorbs the green*<br/>
|Nothing happens|<br/>

[S]	Radi'lus:	- Now I see why you are so powerful. You are a consecrated dodger! You must die! Die! Here and now, die!<br/>
	Kavadar: 	- Yeah? And what is this thing consecrated dogder? Why everyone hates this thing?<br/>
- Oh no, no ,no,no. You are chosen! Chosen by the Necrosis to go back to the prevous realm! We should stop you!<br/>
- What? Wait, what is the Necrosis, what prevous realm?<br/>
			- You really don't know ah?<br/>
			- Obviously.<br/>
			- Well I will not tell you.<br/>
			- Eh, ok then. Bye! *goes away*<br/>
			- Wait, where do you think you are going?<br/>
			- I don't know. Wherever this path lead me.<br/>
			- Eh... eeh.. Wait! I want to give you something for not ending my life. Take this power. *gives the power of green* it should be helpful on your way down.<br/>
			- Oah! Thank you... eh...<br/>
			- Radi'lus.<br/>
			- Radi'lus!, yes thank you. My name is Kavadar by the way.<br/>
 			- Remember one thing, Kavadar. We are not friends, I give you this gift so you can get corrupt... ah... I mean... from pure kindness. The next time I see you I will kill you.<br/>
			- Then I will be ready to throw your stones on your own head. Goodbye Radi'lus! *goes away*<br/>

|Player receives something, idk xD we will think about it|<br/>

### [The blue ones]
Kavadar notices that the dungeon is going more and more deeper down. Eventualy he finds an old sign that says:<br/> "We came from Terrene, but Necrosis gave birth to us. Together with thy zingiberene we signed a truce. For the cause of defeating thy gods. So we won, omitting the odds"<br/>
Kavadar: -Hm... I am very intrigued. I should find more information about the past of this place. Better open my eyes for such signs.<br/>
Again Kavadar eventualy meets the ruler of the blue biome Semigod Of Blue. <br/>

Bubble'Blu: -Ah! You should be the consecrated one. I have heared what you did in the Red and the Green biome. And honestly I should thank you. Now my people will manage to take over their terrotories easier.
We shall not fight now. I will even forgive you for slaughtering some of my men and let you go. What do you say dodger ? <br/>
Kavadar choses to agree[A] or to continue the conversation[C] <br/>

[A] Kavadar: -Well ok. You seem like a nice guy. Thank you. *goes on his way* <br/>
|Semigod Of Blue attacks him while Kavadar is defenceless and the battle begins with Kavadar on half health|<br/>

[C] Kavadar: -And why should I trust you? Don't you need to kill me because I am a consecrated one like the other rulers?<br/>
Buble'Blu:- No... no,no,no. You see dodger I am not like the others. I don't follow the rules of this wreched realm. I like to use a good chance when I see it. You understand?<br/>
-Ok... May I ask you something?<br/>
-Sure dodger.<br/>
-What is your name? <br/>
-I am Bubble'Blu! The Semigod Of Blue.<br/>
-Ok, Semigod Of Blue. If you don't want to kill me then tell me why there are some of your people above us, being ready to shoot me?<br/>
-Eh? Well they... Oh crap! Ok boys, kill him!<br/>
|Fight begins|<br/>

A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Semigod of Blue [K] or to spare him [S] <br/>

[K] Kavadar: -Your lies are sharper than your trident, Semigod! <br/>
Buble'Blu: - No! Dodger, listen to me, I can help you! I can help you find the way to Terrene. Just let me be!<br/>
-Your lies will not be able to hurt anyone anymore! Goodbye, Samigod! <br/>
*absorbs the blue power from the semigod*<br/>
|Player receives something|

[S] Kavadar: -Your lies are sharper than your trident, Semigod! <br/>
Buble'Blu: - No! Dodger, listen to me, I can help you! I can help you find the way to Terrene. Just let me be!<br/>
-First tell me what is happening and why everyone tries to kill me ? <br/>
-If the other rulers find out that I told you they will kill me! <br/>
-It's either them or me. Which do you choose? <br/>
-oh... Ok, ok. I will tell you. Now listen. Dodgers like you are meant to go back to the realm you came from. You were a good person there probably. Talanted at something. But since
The Long Forgotten Gods fell we decided not to let anyone come back anymore.<br/>
-Wait... What? I... I again have more questions than answers. Why and how did I came here? What are these gods? Why you don't allow people to go to this realm? What is happening?<br/>
-Oh you poor dodger. Look at yourself. Do you remember your body to look like that? ... You are dead dodger...<br/>
-This... this cannot be. I don't remember anything like that... Now when I think about it... I don't remember anything!<br/>
-Your memories are lost, dodger. Only your knowledge remains. This is what remains through all the realms you go through.<br/>

Crowd of mixed color beings: -Kavadar! Kavadar! Kavadar!<br/>

Buble'Blu: -I think you will have a company.<br/>
Kavadar: -I guess so.<br/>
-Ok good luck... Kavadar. Don't be a stranger!<br/>
-Hey I thought you will help me... Eh.. whatever... *some big drop of water falls on Kavadar and he receives the blue power from Buble'Blu*<br/>

Buble'Blu leaves and many mixed color beings come to attack Kavadar. Most of them are from colors that he met already, but some of them are like Borwn and Pink.<br/>

### [The crossroad]

After Kavadar defeats or escapes from the crowd he will be on a crossroad. He will be able to choose between two paths. One that leads forward and one that leads seemingly only down. It does not matter which one
he will choose exactly, because anyway after he does one he will need to do the other as well. Lets say he chooses the path down. After many obsticles, traps and enemies he reaches the deepest area in the doungeon
There are few puzzels with colors that he does not posses. Eventually he reaches a shaft where he hears a distant voice. <br/>

God Tsal: -Who is there? Is it you again Plum'fe? Didn't you get tired of shaming me for my blunder?<br/>
Kavadar: -Eh... no. My name is Kavadar. How did you get in there?<br/>
-Kava...? Kavadar? colored beings should not have names. Are you a new ruler that claimed the powers that once were part of mine?<br/>
-Well no. I am just trying to find the way out if this place.<br/>
-The way out? Are you...? Are you a consecrated dodger?<br/>
-Yeaaas... This is what some creatures here called me.<br/>
-Oh no! I am literaly the only person in this realm that will help you, believe it or not. But first you need to get me out of here! Only we can help each other.<br/>
-Ok but how can you help me ?<br/>
-I know how to defeat the rulers of thy realm! As well as how to bring you back to Terrene.<br/>
-Terrene... You mean... You know how to bring me back to life ?<br/>
-Yes! And I will. Just you need to get me out of here!<br/>
-Ok then, how should I do that?<br/>
-It will not be easy. You will need to find Empress Ov Pinks - Plum'fe. You need to steal her key to this shaft so I can climb out.<br/>
-Where can I find her?<br/>
-*esfe afegv egfer*<br/>
-What? You are too far away, I can't hear.<br/>
-* dsfsd refg s sfws*<br/>
-Ok you know what? I will find her by myself, don't worry. I will be back soon.<br/>
-Be careful dodger! Don't consume any *safs fse*, because they will *safew* you!<br/>
-I can't hear you, but ok! I will deal with it.<br/>

# GAME LORE
************

### [Characters]
Kavadar: A person that died in the realm of the living, aka Earth and came in the world of the dead without having any idea who he is, where he is and what happened. His goal
is to find out what is happening as well to decide what he should do in this realm.<br/>

The Color Beings: The Color Beings were created by The Long Forgotten Gods. Each color corresponds to a different area of existing. Each unconsecrated dodger would become a color being
and specificly the type of being that corresponds of their failed purpose in the previous realm - Terrene. For example, if a dodger failed to become a great warrior in their past life, they would become
a red being so they can become wariors in this realm more easy. This way they would serve to The Long Forgotten Gods as a punishment for not improving anyhow the previous realm. The Color Beings
rose up eventualy and overthrowed The Long Forgotten Gods, locking them in the deepest corner of Deathland as a revenge, so they can never rule them again. The main leaders of the rebelion separated
the realm equaly. Since then they all made a promise to never let a dodger reach the gates to the previous realm, so the realm of Terrene can blunder and The Long Forgotten Gods's dream of improving it, gets 
destroyed. After time The Color Beings became greedy and started a war for teritory between each other. Sadly the war stays till nowadats as well as the promise.<br/>

The Long Forgotten Gods: They are the gods that created the realm Deathland for the mortals, as well as many other realms. They were the most powerful creatures in the universe
but long time ago were overthrown by the people of Deathland. They were trapped somewhere deep in Deathland and were never heard of again. This happened so long time ago, that everybody forgot
their names and just refered to them as The Long Forgotten Gods.<br/>

God Tsal: Tsal have been a part of the original Long Forgotten Gods and participated in the creation of each realm. After he and his like-minded brothers were overthrown he was prisoned with them
for the next hundred thousends years or so. His brothers refused to stay prisoners and used their last remaining power to convert their phisical bodies into energy and with it cause the territory
war between the biome rulers. This way there was a new hope that at least Tsal will be able to raise again and bring peace in the final realm. <br/>
	
Knight Of Red: Her name is Redéye. She is a villian who rules the Red. Her father was the one who helped in the rebelion against The Long Forgotten Gods and calimed the title as ruler of the Red.
After his final death Redéye came on the throne as the new ruler. She is powerfull looking with pretty agressive fighting style, mainly with longsword and with shield. Even though her fighting style is fast
and agressive it remains pretty predictable. She can use magic as well and summon fireballs.<br/>

Lord Moss: His name is Radi'lus. He is a villian who rules the Green. He and his brothers were part of the rebelion against The Long Forgotten Gods. After they defeated them they separated the
green biome between each other. In time the brothers grew hungry for more power and started the Green War, which ended with Radi'lus killing all of his brothers and keeping all the green biome for himself.
His prefered weapons are mace, moss magic and toxic waste. Using his moss powers he can move fast for short periods of time. Generaly his attacks are slow and heavy with lack of precision. Yet his
furious confidence and agression are visible.<br/>

Semigod Of Blue: His name is Buble'Blu. He is son of Qui'nBlu. A regular female color being, which long ago managed to steal some power from The Long Forgotten Gods while the rebelion and became a ruler
of the Blue biome. The biome was pretty calm under her leadership untill her final death caused by the god powers she had. Later on Buble'Blu claimed her powers and led the Blue biom into the territory war
with other nations that continues even today. His prefered weapons are water bubbles, trident, water magic that make you drawn yourself if you move for 5 seconds after it's casted.<br/>



### [Locations]

mortals, so the unsuccessfull ones can spend their eternaty serving the gods. While the succsessfull ones
could go back to the previous realm and live and improve the realm further. Sadly after time the citizens of
Deathland took over the realm as revenge against The long forgotten gods. They became guardians of thy
